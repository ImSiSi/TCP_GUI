# TCP_GUI

This is a practice project that combines a Qt-based GUI with socket programming in C++.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to build a simple graphical interface using **Qt** that allows users to:

- Connect to a specific server and port
- Send and receive messages using TCP sockets
- Learn how to integrate GUI programming (with Qt) and network communication (with sockets)

## Features

- User-friendly interface built with **Qt Widgets**
- Basic TCP client functionality
- Real-time communication with a server
- Designed for educational and self-practice purposes

## Technologies Used

- C++
- **Qt 6** (Qt Widgets for GUI)
- BSD Sockets (for TCP communication)

## Build & Run

### Requirements

- Qt 6 or above
- C++ compiler (e.g. g++, clang)
- CMake

### Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/TCP_GUI.git
